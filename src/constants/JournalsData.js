I’m doing it right now — right now as I write this, having not even been awake for half an hour.The more I mature into my role as an entrepreneur — as a leader — as someone who’s still “growing up” — the more I continue to understand the importance of action. We’re all thinkers — some deeper than others — but very few of us are true men and women of action. We over-think because it’s a hell of a lot easier to wonder “what if?” than to prove, “why not?”'

It can turn instinctive and assertive decision making into agonizing ordeals of misguided determination. Over-thinking can also penetrate and sprout turmoil into the parts of the day we ought to set aside for ourselves to relax.'
